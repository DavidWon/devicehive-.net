WriteLiteral("\r\n\r\n<h1>Get Started</h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The DeviceHive API is the central part of the fram" +
"ework which allows different components to interact with each other.\r\nThe API pr" +
"ovides access to information about registered components in the system, and allo" +
"ws them to exchange messages in real time.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Use Cases</h2>\r\n\r\n<p>There" +
" are three types of consumers of the DeviceHive API, as shown on the diagram bel" +
"ow:</p>\r\n\r\n<img src=\"{image-path}/Images/UseCases.png\" alt=\"Use Cases\" />\r\n\r\n<h3" +
">Device</h3>\r\n<p>Device is a unit that runs microcode, and it communicates with " +
"the API in the following cases:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>When started, device register" +
"s within the framework by passing unique identifier, display name and other meta" +
"-information.</li>\r\n    <li>Device sends notifications with an arbitrary content" +
" format to notify other components about the changes in the device\'s environment" +
".</li>\r\n    <li>Device listens for commands issued by other components and execu" +
"tes them in an appropriate way.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Client</h3>\r\n<p>Client is an " +
"application that is used to monitor and/or control devices.\r\nIt could be a user " +
"interface, or completely automated software that manages the entire device netwo" +
"rk.\r\nClients may invoke the API in the following use cases:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>C" +
"lient enumerates all the devices in the network, view their status and other met" +
"a-information.</li>\r\n    <li>Client listens for device notifications and process" +
"es them in an appropriate way.</li>\r\n    <li>Client sends commands to devices to" +
" trigger any logic on the device side.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Administrator</h3>\r\n<p" +
">Administrator controls all aspects of the environment with the full access to t" +
"he API.\r\nCommonly, administrators will need to use this API in the following cas" +
"es:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li>Administrator creates and manages API users (clients and " +
"other administrators).</li>\r\n    <li>Administrator creates and manages device ne" +
"tworks and associates users with them.</li>\r\n    <li>Administrator monitors devi" +
"ces and all dispatched notifications and commands.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Resources<" +
"/h2>\r\n<p>The DeviceHive API is a RESTful service, which operates on several reso" +
"urce types.\r\nThe diagram below reflects all used resource types and their relati" +
"onships:</p>\r\n<img src=\"{image-path}/Images/DataModel.png\" alt=\"Data Model\" />\r\n" +
"<ul>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Reference/User\">User</a>: represents a user with credent" +
"ials and API access rights (client or administrator).</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Re" +
"ference/Network\">Network</a>: represents an isolation entity that encapsulates m" +
"ultiple devices with controlled access.</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Reference/Device" +
"\">Device</a>: represents a unit that runs microcode.</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Ref" +
"erence/DeviceClass\">Device Class</a>: represents an entity that holds all meta-i" +
"nformation about particular type of devices.</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Reference/E" +
"quipment\">Equipment</a>: represents meta-information about one unit of equipment" +
" devices have onboard.</li>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Reference/DeviceNotification\">Dev" +
"ice Notification</a>: represents a message dispatched by devices for clients.</l" +
"i>\r\n    <li><a href=\"#Reference/DeviceCommand\">Device Command</a>: represents a " +
"message dispatched by clients for devices.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h2>Server Processes</" +
"h2>\r\n<p>Besides the CRUD access to all resources listed above, the API includes " +
"several business features implemented on the server side. The sections below pro" +
"vide more information about their implementation.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Message routing</h3" +
">\r\n<p>One of the primary features of the service is to connect devices with clie" +
"nts in real-time. This is achieved on the server-side by routing new commands an" +
"d notification to their recipients with minimal delays.</p>\r\n<p>There are three " +
"methods for API clients to receive incoming messages:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n    <li><strong" +
">Polling</strong>: The client periodically requests the server to retrieve new <" +
"a href=\"#Reference/DeviceCommand/poll\">commands</a> or <a href=\"#Reference/Devic" +
"eNotification/poll\">notifications</a>. The request must include the <em>waitTime" +
"out=0</em> parameter to disable waiting on the server.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Lon" +
"g Polling</strong>: The client makes request to the server, but the server respo" +
"nds only when a new message is available, or if the waiting timeout is expired (" +
"specified in the <em>waitTimeout</em> parameter). That approach is generally mor" +
"e efficient and minimizes message receive delays.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>WebSocke" +
"t</strong>: A separate <a href=\"#WsReference\">WebSocket API</a> allows clients t" +
"o open persistent connections with the server, subscribe to particular commands " +
"or notifications and then receive messages from the server. The URL of the WebSo" +
"cket endpoint could be retrieved using the <a href=\"#Reference/ApiInfo/get\">ApiI" +
"nfo: get</a> call.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>In all three methods it\'s possible to specify" +
" the <em>timestamp</em> parameter as starting date/time (non-inclusive) for inco" +
"ming messages. If that parameter is omitted, the server\'s current timestamp is t" +
"aken instead.</p>\r\n<p>In order to receive all messages in the right order, the c" +
"lients should always pass the timestamp of the last received message when pollin" +
"g or subscribing. If no messages were ever received, the client should get the s" +
"erver\'s current timestamp using the <a href=\"#Reference/ApiInfo/get\">ApiInfo: ge" +
"t</a> call and use it until a new message is received.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Tracking devic" +
"e equipment state</h3>\r\n<p>One of the useful features provided by the server is " +
"tracking the most recent state of device equipment (e.g. sensors, meters, etc.)." +
" The API clients may use the <a href=\"#Reference/Device/equipment\">Device: equip" +
"ment</a> operation to receive the current state of the device equipment.</p>\r\n<p" +
">In order to support that functionality, devices must send properly formatted <a" +
" href=\"#Reference/DeviceNotification/insert\">notifications</a> about changes in " +
"the current equipment state. The notification resource must include the followin" +
"g properties:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>notification</strong>: Must be \'equipme" +
"nt\'.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>parameters</strong>: Must be a JSON object with the \'" +
"equipment\' property containing the corresponding equipment code. Other propertie" +
"s in the JSON object should reflect the equipment state.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Serv" +
"er-originated notifications</h3>\r\n<p>Devices are not the only source of notifica" +
"tions in the system: the server also generates special notifications about vario" +
"us device events. The list below includes all such notifications with their desc" +
"ription:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>$device-add</strong>: Dispatched once for ne" +
"wly registered device. The notification includes all device properties specified" +
" during registration.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>$device-update</strong>: Dispatched " +
"every time device properties are updated (e.g. device name, status, etc.). The n" +
"otification includes only the changed properties. If no properties were changed," +
" the notification parameters property is an empty object.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n\r\n<h3>Aut" +
"omatic Offline device status</h3>\r\n<p>The server provides a capability to auto-u" +
"pdate the device status to Offline after certain period of inactivity. A device " +
"is considered to be inactive when it does not send any notifications for a speci" +
"fied period of time. Please note the status is not currently reverted to the ori" +
"ginal value when a device is brought back online.</p>\r\n<p>The feature is enabled" +
", if a corresponding <a href=\"#Reference/DeviceClass\">device class</a> includes " +
"a positive offlineTimeout property.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Authentication</h2>\r\n<p>The API s" +
"upports two types of authentication: User and Device.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>User</h3>\r\n<p>T" +
"he users are authenticated using <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_acc" +
"ess_authentication\" target=\"_blank\">HTTP Basic Authentication</a>.</p>\r\n<p>The a" +
"ccess is provided based on authenticated user role (Client or Administrator), pl" +
"ease refer to the <a href=\"#Reference\">Reference</a> for the list of available r" +
"esources and methods for each user role.</p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Device</h3>\r\n<p>Devices are " +
"authenticated by passing two custom HTTP headers:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>Aut" +
"h-DeviceID</strong>: Device unique identifier.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>Auth-Device" +
"Key</strong>: Device authentication key.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Both device unique iden" +
"tifier and authentication key are specified during <a href=\"#Reference/Device/re" +
"gister\">device registration</a>.</p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Response Codes</h2>\r\n<p>The API uses" +
" HTTP Status Codes to notify clients about the status of requested operation. As" +
" usual, the 2xx codes indicate the operation has been completed successfully, th" +
"e 4xx codes indicate client errors, and 5xx codes reflect server errors.</p>\r\n<p" +
">The list below provides some additional information about common status codes r" +
"eturned by API operations:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n    <li><strong>200 OK</strong>: Requested" +
" operation completed successfully. The response body includes a resource object " +
"as specified in the API reference.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>201 Created</strong>: R" +
"equested operation completed successfully and a new resource has been created (t" +
"ypically for POST operations). The HTTP Location header includes the URL of crea" +
"ted resource. The response body includes created resource object as specified in" +
" the API reference.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>204 No Content</strong>: Requested ope" +
"ration completed successfully and there is no resource in the response body (typ" +
"ically for DELETE operations).</li>\r\n    <li><strong>400 Bad Request</strong>: T" +
"he client did not specify all required parameters or some parameters passed are " +
"invalid. The response body includes a JSON object with the \'message\' property de" +
"scribing the error details.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>401 Unauthorized</strong>: The" +
" client did not specify authentication headers or access to the requested resour" +
"ce is not allowed for the current identity. The response body includes a JSON ob" +
"ject with the \'message\' property describing the error details.</li>\r\n    <li><st" +
"rong>403 Forbidden</strong>: The server could not complete the requested operati" +
"on with the specified parameters (e.g. network with such name already exists). T" +
"he response body includes a JSON object with the \'message\' property describing t" +
"he error details.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>404 Not Found</strong>: The specified re" +
"source is not found. The response body includes a JSON object with the \'message\'" +
" property describing the error details.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>405 Method Not All" +
"owed</strong>: The specified operation for the current resource is not allowed. " +
"The response body includes a JSON object with the \'message\' property describing " +
"the error details.</li>\r\n    <li><strong>500 Internal Server Error</strong>: The" +
" server error occurred while processing requested operation. The expected respon" +
"se format is not documented.</li>\r\n</ul>");
